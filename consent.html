  <h2>Participant Information</h2>
  
  <p>
    <span class="prj">Name of Project:</span>
    Mistletoe Mimicry

  <p>
If you decide to participate, you will be asked to view standardised images of leaves and
tell us if you think the centre leaf belongs to the same species as the leaves on the left or the right side. You will be asked to score a total of 15
images, and the task will take less than 3 minutes. From your responses we will obtain
the frequency with which each pair of leaves are considered to be from the same or different species as well as the time it took
each participant to score each image.

  <p>
The only information collected is participant choices, the time when the game was played and whether the participant self-identified as a new user or returning user. Optionally, participants may provide their email address at the end of the game so they can be notified when the results are published. No individual will be identified in any publication of the results.
A summary of the results of the data can also be made available on request via email.
Participation in this study is entirely voluntary: you are not obliged to participate and if
you decide to participate, you are free to withdraw at any time without having to give a
reason and without consequence.
